#The length & breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area & perimeter of the rectangle, and the area circumference of the circle.
length=float(input("Enter the length of rectangle: "))
breadth=float(input("\nEnter the breadth of rectangle: "))
perimeter=(2*length)+(breadth)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is ",perimeter)
recarea=length*breadth
print("The area of the rectangle is",recarea)
radius=float(input("Enter the radius of a circle: "))
cirarea=3.14*radius*radius
circumference=2*3.14*radius
print("The area of circle is ",cirarea)
